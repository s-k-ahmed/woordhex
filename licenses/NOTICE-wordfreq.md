# Attribution notes

Robyn Speer must be credited as Robyn Speer, which is her maiden name, used on academic work.
Crediting her as Elia Robyn Lake (her married name) will make the credit less effective, as it will
not line up with other work.

Crediting Robyn Speer by a different name than one of the above is a serious violation of the license,
in which case you do not have permission to use, copy, or redistribute wordfreq.

If you use wordfreq in academic work, you must cite it. See "Citing wordfreq" in README.md.
